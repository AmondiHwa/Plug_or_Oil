## About
The aim in this project is to analyze the trend of sales with the Alternate Fuel Vehicles (AFV) and Electric Vehicles (EV) between the years of 2018 and 2022. 
I want to compare the both variables with an additional step of predicting sales in 2022, with the outlook towards 2023. 

In addition to analyzing the current problem with gas price inflation and its impact on the EV sales.

## Brainstorming Q's
* Due to the pandemic, and possible tarrif between Russia and Ukraine, there is a shortage in oil. Hence the gas price inflation. Are EV's the more conciderable purchase over AFV's? 

## Reasources Used
